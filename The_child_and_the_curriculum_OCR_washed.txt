Profound differences in theory are never gratuitous or invented. 
They grow out of conflicting elements in a genuine problem a 
problem which is genuine just because the elements, taken as 
they stand, are conflicting. Any significant problem involves conditions 
that for the moment contradict each other. Solution 
comes only by getting away from the meaning of terms that is 
already fixed upon and coming to see the conditions from another
point of view, and hence in a fresh light. But this reconstruction
means travail of thought. Easier than thinking with surrender 
of already formed ideas and detachment from facts already 
learned is just to stick by what is already said, looking about for 
something with which to buttress it against attack.
